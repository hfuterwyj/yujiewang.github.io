I received my Bachelor’s Degree in the School of Mathematics from Hefei University of Technology in 2020 and received my Master's degree in the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology in 2023. I am currently a Ph.D Student in School of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Hefei University of Technology. Since the fall of 2020, I am under the supervision of [Prof. Kui Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/yukuiwebsite/).
